 * 1) The card component should take in props. Display all the data within the card
 * 2) For whatever reason, we want to let users click on the card and also keep track of how many times we did so!
 *    So, we should also create some sort of logic to keep track of how many times someone clicks on a card!
 * 
 * NOTE: It's fine if the styling isn't perfect bc who knows CSS off the top of their head anyways
